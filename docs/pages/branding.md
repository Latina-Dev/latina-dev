## Logo

<img src="https://latina.dev/img/logos/logo.png" width="50" />

We decided to base our logo on the South American great horned owl that can be found throughout the Americas.

The owl is a symbol of wisdom and knowledge which is a nod to our intersectional identity as Latina software engineers.

The owl is also a symbol of death and rebirth, which is a nod to our mission of helping Latinas transition into software engineering and thrive in their careers.
